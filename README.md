# number_guessing

* This is a really basic "guess the number" game: The computer will think about one random number and you have to guess which one it is.

* Set difficulty and begin your guessing journey.

* Once you guess your first number, you will get the number of tries you needed to win, in other words: the score to beat.

* If you get tired during the guessing (right after setting the desired difficulty), you can press "f" for f (exit the game).

* After each game, you will be asked if you want to keep playing or not. 

* If you decide to stop playing, before you leave, you will get the statistics of your whole game session.

The entire code is made by me.
